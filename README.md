## CONTRIBUTING.md
CONTRIBUTING.md is an open Hacktoberfest meetup for anyone who wants to join. You might be interested in learning more about how you can contribute, we'll have some people over from fun projects to join and you can meet the community and network. Are you curious about the projects? Check back regularly at [our meetup page](https://contributing.today/) to see our interviews with contributors & maintainers.

## Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel — is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this online meetup? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. [Sign up to participate today](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
