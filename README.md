## CONTRIBUTING.md
CONTRIBUTING.md is a virtual Hacktoberfest meetup, free and open for anyone who wants to join. Learn what Open Source projects are looking for contributions, which communities are looking for new members, and who is looking for advice from someone with your exact skill set. Check [our meetup page](https://contributing.today/) regularly to watch interviews with contributors & maintainers we'll release until the event.

## Hosted by
Nick Trogh and Suzanne Daniels
From Contributing.today
We're looking forward to bring together the communities we work with, get them excited about contributing to Open Source software, or find new communities and projects to work on. While the organizers all work for the same major tech company, that's just coincidental. It's merely how we've found each other.

## Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest â€” brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel â€” is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small â€” bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this online meetup? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. [Sign up to participate today](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
